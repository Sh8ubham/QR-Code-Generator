# QR-Code-Generator
just install node modules and you are good to go as I created this as a exercise for myself in case i forget something so i can revise 
Key Takeaways I had:
Utilized the inquirer and qr-image Node.js packages to build a QR Code Generator.
Gathered user input via the terminal and generated a QR code image from a URL.
Saved both the generated QR image and the input URL as a text file using the fs module.
Emphasized the importance of reading documentation and understanding dependencies in Node.js projects.
